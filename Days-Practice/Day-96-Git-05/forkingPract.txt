Step 1: Fork and Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sample-project.git
cd sample-project

Step 2: Add the original project as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/sample-project.git

Step 3: Check remotes
git remote -v

Step 4: Create a new branch to work on a feature or issue
git checkout -b fix-readme

Step 5: Make changes and commit
echo "New line" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added a new line to README"

Step 6: Push changes to your fork
git push origin fix-readme

Step 7: Go to GitHub and open a pull request to the upstream repo

Step 8: Sync with upstream later
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream main
