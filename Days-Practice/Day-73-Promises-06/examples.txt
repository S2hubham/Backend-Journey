1️⃣ Promise.all() - Stock Market Dashboard
🔹 Scenario: A stock market dashboard fetches live stock prices, financial news, and market trends from different APIs. All this data is needed together for accurate insights.

✅ Why Promise.all()?
We must have all data before updating the dashboard.
If any API fails, showing partial stock data could be misleading.
It ensures synchronized and reliable information.



2️⃣ Promise.allSettled() - Bus Ticket Booking System
🔹 Scenario: A bus ticket booking platform checks availability from multiple bus operators. Even if some providers fail to respond, users should still see the available options.
✅ Why Promise.allSettled()?
All responses matter, whether success or failure.
Users can still book from the available bus services even if some fail.
Prevents a single API failure from blocking the entire booking process.


    
3️⃣ Promise.any() - Weather Application
🔹 Scenario: A weather app fetches data from multiple weather providers. It picks the first successful response to ensure users get the forecast as quickly as possible.
✅ Why Promise.any()?
Users don't need all responses, just the fastest one.
Reduces waiting time by accepting the first available forecast.
Ensures a smooth user experience even if some APIs are slow or fail.
