--Shell script
    -A shell script is a file where you write Linux commands line by line, and when you run the file, all the commands are executed automatically one after another.
Just imagine:
    -Instead of typing 10 commands manually one by one,
    -You write those 10 commands inside a file,
    -Then run the file once, and everything happens automatically.

Terms:
    -Extension: Usually .sh (like myscript.sh).
    -Interpreter: Shell (like bash) reads and runs it line-by-line.
    -First line: #!/bin/bash — called a shebang, tells which shell to use.
    -Purpose: Automation (makes repeating tasks super easy).
