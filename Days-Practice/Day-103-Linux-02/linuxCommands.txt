    cd ../.. : if you want to make two jumps back from the current directory.
    cd ~ : from any directory this will help you to come back to the home directory.
    cd directory1/directory2/ : we can move into internal subdirectories directly by separating them with a forward slash L .

Note :
    ~   -> this tilde refers to the home directory. Ex: /Users/shubham.

    Paths : 
    Relative Path describes the location of a file/folder w.r.t current folder.
    In an absolute path we mention the location from home directory or root directory. Always starts from / (root)

    When you give the absolute path of a file or folder that means you will give the whole path of that file or folder, 
    whereas in the relative path you do jumps w.r.t to the current folder.


-clear : clears the working space by actually moving you to the top of the current shell.

-mkdir : this helps us to create a new folder.

-touch : we can create a brand new blank file out of the blue. 

-cat <filename> : prints the whole content of a file

-rm <filename> : is command deletes a file

-rmdir <foldername> : this commands deletes `only` empty folder

-rm -r <foldername> : the -r flag enables rm to recursively delete all the content of the folder and then delete the folder.

-rm -rf <foldername> : forcefully deletes all contents of the folder and then the folder.

Command	            Description
