🔹 What is Unix?
A multiuser, multitasking operating system developed in the 1970s.
The foundation/inspiration for many modern OSes like Linux, BSD, macOS.
Structured with: Kernel + Shell + Utilities + Filesystem


🔹 Key Terms:
    Kernel: The core part of an OS, manages hardware.
    Shell: Interface between user and OS (e.g., bash).
    Multiuser: Multiple users can log in and use the same system.
    Multitasking: Running multiple programs simultaneously.
    Derivative: A system created based on another system.


🔹 What is Linux?
A Unix-like open-source OS built around the Linux kernel (created by Linus Torvalds in 1991).
Runs on PCs, servers, smartphones, TVs, routers, etc.
Has many distributions (distros) for different use cases.


🔹 What is BSD?
    Berkeley Software Distribution — a Unix variant.
    macOS is built on BSD (specifically Darwin, a BSD-based system).
    Known for security, performance, and server use.
Popular BSDs:
    FreeBSD – Performance/server use
    OpenBSD – Security-focused
    NetBSD – Hardware portability
    macOS – Apple’s OS based on BSD


🔹 What is a Distro?
A Linux distro (distribution) = Linux kernel + software tools + GUI + package manager.
Different distros are created by different organizations/communities for specific purposes.


🔹 Distro Families
🟢 Debian-based
    Debian: Stable, secure, base-level distro.
    Ubuntu: User-friendly version of Debian.
    Kali Linux: Ethical hacking, pen-testing (built on Ubuntu).
    Linux Mint, Pop!_OS: Variants of Ubuntu with extra features.

🔴 Red Hat-based
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): Enterprise-focused, paid support.
    Fedora: Cutting-edge, developer-focused, backed by Red Hat.
    CentOS / CentOS Stream: Free version/variant of RHEL, used on servers.

Distro	    Uses Linux Kernel	Independent Base	Derived From
Debian	    ✅	                ✅	             –
Ubuntu	    ✅	                ❌	             Debian
Kali Linux	✅	                ❌	             Ubuntu
RHEL	    ✅	                ✅	             –
Fedora	    ✅	                ❌	             RHEL
CentOS	    ✅	                ❌	             RHEL


🔹 Why Linux Kernel is Famous?
    Free & Open Source – No license needed, anyone can use and modify it.
    Highly Customizable – Can be tailored for phones, PCs, servers, or even rockets!
    Strong Community – Thousands of developers and big companies contribute.
    Modular Design – Only use the features you need = faster, lighter, safer.
    Runs Everywhere – Powers Android, servers, smart devices, supercomputers.
    Stable & Secure – Trusted by Google, Facebook, Amazon, NASA, etc.
    Scalable – Works for small IoT devices to huge data centers.
