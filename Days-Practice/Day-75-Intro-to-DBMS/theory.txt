DBMS : 
    -A DBMS is a software system that enables the creation, management, and use of databases. It provides systematic methods for storing, retrieving, and managing data.
    -Importance:
        Data Abstraction & Independence: Separates data from the application logic.
        Efficient Data Management: Optimizes storage and retrieval operations.
        Data Integrity & Security: Enforces rules (constraints) to maintain data accuracy and protects data from unauthorized access.
        Concurrent Access: Allows multiple users to access and modify data concurrently while maintaining consistency.



SQL (Structured Query Language):
    -Standard language for querying and managing relational databases.
    -Key Functions:
        DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
        DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
        DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE.
    -Crucial Point: SQL is universally supported (with minor variations) across most relational DBMS



RDBMS :
    -Tables (Relations): Organized into rows (records) and columns (attributes).
    -Schema vs. Instance:
        Schema: The overall structure of the database (tables, relationships, constraints).
        Instance: The actual data stored at any given time.
    -Normalization:
        Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.).
    -ACID Properties:
        Atomicity: Ensures that transactions are all-or-nothing.
        Consistency: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.
        Isolation: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
        Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will persist even in case of system failure.
