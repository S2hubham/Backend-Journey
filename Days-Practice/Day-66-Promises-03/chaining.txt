1. Initial Execution (Synchronous Phase):
Promise.resolve("Foo") returns a resolved promise with the value "Foo".
The first .then() is scheduled in the microtask queue.
console.log("Hiii...") runs immediately.

✅ Output so far:
Hiii...


2. First .then() Execution (Microtask Phase):
Call Stack: Executes the first .then() from the microtask queue.
Inside the first .then():
    Returns a new Promise.
    setTimeout() schedules a macrotask to run after 1000ms.
Since this .then() returns a Promise, the next .then() waits for this to resolve.


3. Macrotask Phase (After 1000ms):
Call Stack: Executes the setTimeout() callback.
Inside the callback:    
    "Foo" + "bar" → "Foobar"
    resolve("Foobar") is called.
This triggers the second .then() and puts it in the microtask queue.



4. Second .then() Execution (Microtask Phase):
Call Stack: Executes the second .then().
Inside the second .then():
    Schedules another setTimeout() for 1000ms (macrotask).
    Returns "Foobar" to the next .then().
Third .then() is added to the microtask queue.


 
5. Third .then() Execution (Microtask Phase):
Call Stack: Executes the third .then().
Inside the third .then():
Logs:
Last Then: oops ... didn't bother to instantiate and return in the promise in the prior then so the sequence may be a bit suprising
Foobar

✅ Output so far:
Hiii...
Last Then: oops ... didn't bother to instantiate and return in the promise in the prior then so the sequence may be a bit suprising
Foobar


6. Macrotask Phase (After 2000ms Total):
Call Stack: Executes the second setTimeout().
Inside the callback:
    "Foobar" + "baz" → "Foobarbaz"
Logs:
Foobarbaz



✅ Final Output:
Hiii...
Last Then: oops ... didn't bother to instantiate and return in the promise in the prior then so the sequence may be a bit suprising
Foobar
Foobarbaz









Key Points on Promises and .then()


1. .then() Always Returns a Promise:
What it means:
Each call to .then() returns a new promise, even if you simply return a primitive value.
Why it matters:
This behavior allows for chaining multiple .then() calls, letting you control asynchronous flows step by step.


2. Returning a Value vs. a Promise in .then():
Returning a Value:
If you return a simple value (e.g., a number, string, or object), JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved promise.
Example:
Promise.resolve(5)
  .then((value) => {
    return value + 5; // Returns 10 (wrapped as Promise.resolve(10))
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs: 10
  });

Returning a Promise:
If you return a promise, the next .then() waits until that promise resolves before executing.
Example:
Promise.resolve("Hello")
  .then((msg) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(msg + " World"), 1000);
    });
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs "Hello World" after 1 second
  });


3. Not Returning a Promise (or any value):
What happens:
If you don’t return anything from a .then() callback, it implicitly returns undefined (wrapped in a resolved promise). This means the next .then() receives undefined and runs immediately.
Example:
Promise.resolve("Hello")
  .then((msg) => {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(msg + " World"), 1000); // Asynchronous task (Macrotask)
  })
  .then((value) => {
    console.log("Immediate Log", value); // Logs "Immediate Log undefined" immediately
  });
Explanation:
The first .then() schedules a setTimeout() (macrotask) and returns undefined immediately.
The second .then() runs as soon as it receives undefined, before the timeout callback executes.


4. How Promise Chaining Works:
Chaining:
Every time you chain .then(), you build a sequence where each subsequent .then() waits for the previous one to resolve.
Flattening:
If a .then() returns a promise, JavaScript “flattens” it, so the next .then() receives the resolved value of that promise.
Example (Chained Promises):
Promise.resolve("Start")
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // Logs: Start
    return value + " -> Step 1";
  })
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // Logs: Start -> Step 1
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(value + " -> Step 2"), 1000);
    });
  })
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // Logs: Start -> Step 1 -> Step 2 (after 1 second)
  });


  
Summary
Every .then() returns a promise: This is key for chaining.
Returning a value vs. returning a promise:
    Value: Immediate, auto-wrapped.
    Promise: Waits for it to resolve.
Chaining and flattening: When a promise is returned, the chain waits for it, and the resolved value flows down the chain.
Not returning anything: Defaults to undefined, causing immediate progression in the chain.
