1.git status
Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.
Tells which files are modified, staged, untracked, or ready to be committed.

2.git commit
Saves a snapshot of staged changes to the local repository.
Requires a commit message (-m "message") to describe the change.

3.git add .
Adds all modified and new files in the working directory to the staging area.
Prepares them for the next commit.

4.git rm --cached <file_name>
Unstages a file (removes it from the staging area) without deleting it from the working directory.
Useful if you added a file by mistake and want to exclude it from the next commit.
