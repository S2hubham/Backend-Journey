Pagination in SQL (for Google-like results)
Definition:
    Pagination splits large results into pages.
Use case:
    Used in web apps (like Google search results) to show limited results per page.
Syntax (MySQL/PostgreSQL):

SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT limit OFFSET offset;


-LIMIT = how many rows to show
-OFFSET = how many rows to skip

Example:
-- Page 2, 10 results per page
SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

Formula: OFFSET = (page_number - 1) * limit
