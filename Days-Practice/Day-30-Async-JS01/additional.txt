The worst sorting algorithm in terms of efficiency is Bogosort (also called Stupid Sort or Permutation Sort).

🔥 Bogosort Algorithm:
Randomly shuffle the array.
Check if the array is sorted.
If sorted, stop. Otherwise, repeat Step 1.

🤦 Time Complexity:
Worst Case: O(n!) (Factorial time, extremely slow)
Average Case: O(n × n!)
Best Case: O(n) (if already sorted in the first shuffle)

❌ Why is it the Worst?
It relies on pure luck instead of logic.
It is highly inefficient, especially for large inputs.
It could theoretically run forever if the array never gets sorted by chance.


In simple words -> shuffle the array -> check if sorted -> if yes return true , if not keep on shuffling and checking
