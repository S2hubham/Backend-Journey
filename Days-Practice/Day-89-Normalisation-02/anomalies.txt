Original Unnormalized Table (1NF Not Satisfied)

101	        Alice	        DBMS, OOPs	        Dr. Smith	            9999999999	                Computer Science

103	        Charlie	        OOPs, AI	        Dr. Brown	            7777777777	                Computer Science




---Anomalies in This Unnormalized Data
1. Update Anomaly
Problem: Redundant data in multiple places — hard to update consistently.

If Dr. Smith changes his phone number, you have to update it for both Alice and Bob.
If you forget to update one —  inconsistency.

2. Insert Anomaly
Problem: Can't insert data unless it's mixed with unrelated data.

Suppose a new course ML is introduced by Dr. Watson —
Since no student has enrolled yet, you can’t insert just the course info.

3. Delete Anomaly
Problem: Deleting a student might remove important unrelated info.

If you delete Charlie, the only student who took AI,
info about AI course and Dr. Brown also gets lost — even though that data is still relevant.

Now Observe How Anomalies Are Gone
1) Update Anomaly Fixed
Dr. Smith’s phone stored only once in Instructor table.

Update it in one place → reflected everywhere.

2) Insert Anomaly Fixed
Want to add ML course taught by Dr. Watson?

Simply add in Course and Instructor table —
No need to insert dummy student data.

3) Delete Anomaly Fixed
Deleting Charlie from Enrollment doesn’t delete AI course or Dr. Brown.

They stay safe in their own tables.
