Hands-On Practice Scenario (Covers All Commands)
Imagine you're working in a company on a feature branch called feature/navbar. You're midway through updating the navbar and sidebar.

Situation:
You're asked to:
    -Fix a bug on main
    -Pull latest changes
    -Test a new header layout
    -Handle untracked CSS files

Practice Flow:

    # 1. Working on multiple files (tracked + untracked)
    echo "nav code" > navbar.js
    echo "side code" > sidebar.js
    touch temp.css             # untracked

    # 2. Save with message + include untracked
    git stash save "navbar and sidebar updates" --include-untracked

    # 3. Check stash list
    git stash list

    # 4. View stash details
    git stash show stash@{0}

    # 5. Switch to main branch and pull bug fix
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main

    # 6. Return to your branch
    git checkout feature/navbar

    # 7. Apply your stash but keep it
    git stash apply stash@{0}

    # 8. Realize you only need sidebar.js stashed, stash again selectively
    git stash -- sidebar.js

    # 9. Apply and remove it from stash
    git stash pop

    # 10. Drop old stash
    git stash drop stash@{0}

    # 11. Test just temp.css file (untracked)
    git stash --include-untracked -- temp.css
    git stash list


Result:
Youâ€™ve:
    -Stashed full and partial changes
    -Handled untracked files
    -Used apply, pop, drop
    -Tested and organized changes effectively
