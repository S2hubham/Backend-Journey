1. Bug Fix on Another Branch (Urgent Patch Request)
You're working on a new feature, halfway through coding. Suddenly, your team lead says:
"Hey, production is breaking! We need to fix a critical bug on main ASAP."
But you can’t commit your half-baked feature.

Use git stash to save your changes temporarily:
    git stash
    git checkout main
    # fix the bug
    git commit -m "Hotfix for production crash"
    git push
    git checkout feature/new-ui
    git stash pop  # continue where you left off



2. Need to Pull Latest Changes, But You Have Local Modifications
You're on a branch and made changes. Now you want to pull the latest code from the remote repo, but Git says:
"Cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes."
If you don’t want to deal with merge conflicts right now:
    git stash
    git pull --rebase origin main
    git stash pop



3. Quickly Test Something Else
You're writing code, but a teammate says:
"Can you check if this function breaks when passed an empty array?"
Rather than risking your current codebase:
    git stash
    # do some quick testing
    git checkout <testing branch> or modify temporarily
    # done testing
    git checkout your-branch
    git stash pop



4. Clean Working Directory for Running Lint, Test, or Build Scripts
Sometimes, your changes might break the test or build setup. You want to:
    -Run build/lint/test on a clean slate
    -Then restore your messy code after

    git stash
    npm run build
    # success!
    git stash pop



5. Code Review / Pair Programming Help
You're doing feature work, but a teammate asks:
“Can you help me debug something real quick?”
You don’t want to lose your progress but also need a clean working copy to debug with them:
    git stash
    git checkout teammate-branch
    # help them
    git checkout your-feature-branch
    git stash pop


In short ->   
In any serious development environment (companies, startups, open source), stashing is like pressing "Save and Minimize" on your work so you can juggle priorities without losing progress.
