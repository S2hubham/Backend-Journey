Git Branching: 

1. What is a Branch?
    -A branch is simply a pointer to a specific commit.
    -By default, Git creates a branch named master (or main).
    -As you make commits, this pointer moves forward.

Think of it as a named timeline of your project.


2. What is HEAD?
HEAD is a special pointer that tells you:
    -Which branch you're currently on
    -What the latest commit on that branch is


3. Changing branches = moving the HEAD to point to another branch.
   Branch = a pointer to a commit
   HEAD = pointer to the current branch
