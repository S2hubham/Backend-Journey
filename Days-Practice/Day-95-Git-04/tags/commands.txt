What Are Git Tags?
    -Tags are pointers to specific commits — similar to branches, but immutable and meant for marking versions/releases.
    -Useful for marking release points, like v1.0, v2.1, etc.


Difference Between Tag and Branch
Feature	            Branch	                                Tag
Mutable	            Yes (moves with new commits)	        No (fixed to one commit)
Purpose	            Development (ongoing work)	            Marking snapshots/releases
Structure	        Pointer to latest commit + moves	    Pointer to specific commit + frozen
Common Example	    main, feature-x	                        v1.0.0, release-2025


Tagging Commands and Their Uses
1. git tag
List all tags in the repo.
    git tag


2. git tag -a <tag_name> -m "message"
Create an annotated tag with metadata (author, date, message).
    git tag -a v1.0 -m "First release"
Use -a for "annotated" — best practice for production/release.


3. git tag -m "message"
Only works with -a, otherwise it's invalid alone.
Correct usage:
    git tag -a v1.1 -m "Second release"


4. git show <tag_name>
Show details of the tag, including the commit and metadata.
    git show v1.0


5. git show-ref --tags
Show all tag references and their commit hashes.
    git show-ref --tags


6. git push --tags
Push all local tags to the remote.
    git push --tags
