Situation:
You're working on a feature called dark-mode-toggle. You:
    -Create initial logic and commit.
    -Realize you missed CSS.
    -Then, fix a typo in JS.
    -Want to keep all of this in a single clean commit, as per company policy.



Step-by-Step : 
    # Step 1: Create branch and file
    git checkout -b dark-mode-toggle
    echo "function toggleDarkMode() {}" > theme.js
    git add theme.js
    git commit -m "Add dark mode toggle logic"

    # Step 2: Realize CSS is missing
    echo ".dark-mode { background: black; }" > style.css
    git add style.css    
    git commit --amend          # Add this to the last commit
    # Choose to edit the message or leave it as is

    # Step 3: Fix typo in JS
    echo "// toggle dark mode" >> theme.js
    git add theme.js
    git commit --amend          # Again, adds to same commit

    # Step 4: See all commit updates using reflog
    git reflog
    # Youâ€™ll see the commit before and after each amend, each with a new hash

    # Step 5: Verify commit history (should have only 1)
    git log --oneline
